I put the circuit board in a simple casing.

Problems are:
* Holes for ventilation have to be big and numerous enough so that the reading adapts still fast to changed concentrations
* A high internal volume can be filled unwantedly with air which is breathed out. As this air has a very high concentration of CO2 this can disturb the reading for quite some time
* A volume which is connected with only small holes to the volume with the sensor may store CO2. This may disturb the reading of the sensor when this CO2 leaks to the volume with the sensor
