# CO2-Measurement-simple

A very simple CO2 measurement device for about than 40 Euros or 50$. 
There are two designs, one very simple. For this you need a calculator to get the CO2 concentration.
A less simple design uses an analogue multiplier to calculate a voltage that has a simple relation to the ppm value.

Please read this document carefully to see what restrictions follow from this design.

# Simple design

This is the simple design:

The power cable is a cut USB cable.

It uses a MH-Z19B sensor, two integrated operation amplifiers and a small voltmeter.
There is no need for a further microcontroller. 

For potential casings see [Casings](Casing.md).
