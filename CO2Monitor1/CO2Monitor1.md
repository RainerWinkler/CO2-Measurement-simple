# CO2-Measurement-simple

A simple CO2 measurement device for about than 40 Euros or 50$ which does not require an additional microcomputer. It uses an analogue multiplier to show correct ppm values. 

Please read this repository carefully to see what restrictions follow from this design.

# Simple design

This is the simple design:

The power cable is a cut USB cable.

It uses a MH-Z19B sensor, two integrated operation amplifiers and a small voltmeter.
There is no need for a further microcontroller.
