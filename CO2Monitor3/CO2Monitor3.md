# CO2 Monitor 3

A very simple CO2 measurement device for about than 40 Euros or 50$. 

This design uses an Arduino UNO R3. 

You may use this design after you bought the MH-Z19B sensor to test it and to get a basic understanding of CO2 measurement.

Please read this document carefully to see what restrictions follow from this design.
