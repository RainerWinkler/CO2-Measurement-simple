# CO2-Measurement-simple

A very simple CO2 measurement device for about than 40 Euros or 50$. 
This is the most simple design. 
It can be build in a few minutes without soldering.
Only minimal technical understanding is required.
You need a calculator to get the CO2 concentration.

You may use this design after you bought the MH-Z19B sensor to test it and to get a basic understanding of CO2 measurement.

Please read this document carefully to see what restrictions follow from this design.

# Very simple design

This is the very simple design. It needs a conversion table to get the ppm value from the reading. No soldering needed, the connection is made with screw terminals:
