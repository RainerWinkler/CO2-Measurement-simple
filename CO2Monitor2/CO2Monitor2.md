# CO2-Measurement-simple

A very simple CO2 measurement device for about than 40 Euros or 50$. 
There are two designs, one very simple. For this you need a calculator to get the CO2 concentration.
A less simple design uses an analogue multiplier to calculate a voltage that has a simple relation to the ppm value.

Please read this document carefully to see what restrictions follow from this design.

# Very simple design

This is the very simple design. It needs a conversion table to get the ppm value from the reading. No soldering needed, the connection is made with screw terminals:
